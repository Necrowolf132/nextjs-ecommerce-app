# NextJS E-Commerce App

*E-Commerce application using Next.js, React.js, Prisma & Node.js*

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

You are going to need **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

### Installing

How to properly install and configure this repository to work on your machine.

Cloning the repository

```
git clone ...
```

Enter cloned directory

```
cd nextjs-ecommerce-app/
```
Enter Backend directory and do npm install

```
cd nextjs-ecommerce-app/backend && npm install --save
```
Enter Frontend directory and do npm install

```
cd nextjs-ecommerce-app/frontend && npm install --save
```

## Starting the repository on your machine

You will need to run Backend & Frontend seperately, ports are already configured, make sure you don't conflict them if you change anything.

Enter Frontend directory and do npm start

```
cd nextjs-ecommerce-app/frontend && npm start
```
Enter Backend directory and do npm start

```
cd nextjs-ecommerce-app/backend && npm start
```

Now you can load **localhost:7777** in your browser and use the app.
